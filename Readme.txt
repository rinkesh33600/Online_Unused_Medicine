Firstly we make the Enviroment to run the Web Poratl.

So Now We Download php setup from https://windows.php.net/download#php-8.1  then download vs code to run the files.

Then we Installed Xampp server to connect website with Database.

Then we made the tables in the xampp according to the Query written in the php files.

Here we have made Four tables:-
(i)signed_users --> email , password , user_id , username
(ii)contact_us --> user_id , name , email , query
(iii)donate_medicine --> name , email , ph_number , date_of_med , medicine , quantity , state , address
(iv)buy_medicine --> name , email , ph_number , date_of_med , medicine , quantity , state , address

Now we have to open index page which is also known as Home Page of my website.

Then the person register him/herself by sign-up and then he/she login , if the email and password become verified then he/she redirect to page Donation.html

Here he/she take Medical tips , know about developers and contact them in case of any query.

Then he/she either donate Medicine or Buy Medicine.
